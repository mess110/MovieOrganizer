Organize movies (MOD format) from my dad's Panasonic SDR-H40 camcorder into several DVD sized folders. Since I don't know how to burn a DVD in Java, I am using a special program to burn DVDs with the help of Java Robot.

Initially intended to be crossplatform, it became Windows only because of the DVD burner.

The program gets the buttons it needs to press and uses Java Robot to control the mouse.
